A server can send the newest version of the reporter client in response to a GET request on the configured path.
If a version number is sent, the response code should be 200 (Ok)

This service is unnecessary for a ratings server - you can just point the client towards the official Tenco server. However, this could be useful for ensuring that the server supports the client version.

This feature is really for clients, so it is only relevant to the tsk reporter. If you were writing your own client, you would probably have something similar.
