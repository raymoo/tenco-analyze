When a client wants the time of the last record posted for its account, it will
issue a GET request to the designated path on the server, with a query string
containing the following fields:

game_id

game_id is a number (currently) from 1 to 4, identifying one of the touhou
fighting games. Currently, 1 corresponds to SWR, 2 to Soku, 3 to HM demo,
and 4 to HM.


account_name

The username of the account


When successfully getting the last report time, the server should send a message
with response code 200 (Ok) containing the time, in ISO8601 format. If there is
no previous report, the server should send an empty message with response code
204 (No Content)
