<!--
    To post a record of games, the client POSTs the xml to the designated path
    on the server. If the server wants the client to retry in force-insert mode,
    it should send a message containing "<Please Retry in Force-Insert Mode>".
    The server may choose to put something in the message body for display to
    the user. I don't know if this can be mixed with the request for
    forced-insert mode. If recording the report is successful, the response
    should have code 200 (Ok).

    NOTE: Player 1 is always the account the reporting player used.

    NOTE: The timestamps will be affected by local time zone. This is because of
    some uses of GetLocalTime rather than GetSystemTime in the source of
    tensokukan. The reporter also uses Time.localTime in generating timestamps.
    Casty from #hisouten found this, I don't take any credit.
